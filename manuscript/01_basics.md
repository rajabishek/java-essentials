# Strongly typed
Java is a strongly typed language. This means that every variable and every expression in Java has a specific type. There are no automatic coercions or conversions of conflicting types as in some languages. A type compatabilty check is performed everytime a variable assigment is being made or every time an argument is passed to a method. Any mismatch in types are reported as compile time errors and are prevented as early in the development process itself. This is what makes Java highly safe and robust in nature.
