> - Generics are an integral part of Java programming.
> - Through the use of generics, it is possible to create classes, interfaces, and methods that will work in a type-safe manner with various kinds of data.
> - Many algorithms are logically the same no matter what type of data they are being applied to. For example, the mechanism that supports a stack is the same whether that stack is storing items of type `Integer`, `String`, `Object`, or `Thread`.
> - With generics, you can define an algorithm once, independently of any specific type of data, and then apply that algorithm to a wide variety of data types without any additional effort.
