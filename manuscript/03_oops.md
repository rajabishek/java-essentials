A simple definition of a class is given below.
```java
class ClassName {
    String var1;
    int var2;
    
    String getVariable1() {
        return var1;
    }
}
```
> - Class is a template for an object, and an object is an instance of a class. Class essentially defines a new data type.
> - Words object and instance used interchangeably.
